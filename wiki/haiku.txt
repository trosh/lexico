[[old pond]]

old pond . . .
a frog leaps in
waterâ€™s sound

[[cold shower]]

the first cold shower
even the monkey seems to want
a little coat of straw

[[fuji]]

the wind of Mt. Fuji
I've brought on my fan!
a gift from Edo

[[edo]]

how many gallons
of Edo's rain did you drink?
cuckoo

[[hendrik doeff]]

lend me your arms,
fast as thunderbolts,
for a pillow on my journey.
